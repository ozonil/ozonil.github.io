      <description>Browser inspector tools are great as this stackoverflow answer demonstrates. A simple &amp;lsquo;/&amp;rsquo; missing in your config and your CSS is messed up. Fixed the bug. CSS applies to the website now. Kinda neat.
the commit
I could imagine a time when this fix wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have come. I would have other &amp;lsquo;priorities&amp;rsquo; and abandon the whole endevour and delete the repo in a few months after it stales.
Hopefully that changes.</description>

      <description>Immediate followup. CSS is messed up after deployment. Must have something to do with how I didn&amp;rsquo;t do something. It still looks pretty though. Time to let it go and move on to more immediate commitments.
The time it takes to move from creating a new post with hugo new post/post.md with editing the generated page, adding, commiting and pushing is so low that I should be able to crank out posts fast.</description>

      <description>Yet another attempt at making this happen. I have a few guard rails setup this time, so hope it works out.</description>
