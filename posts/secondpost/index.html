  <p>Immediate followup. CSS is messed up after deployment. Must have something to do with how I <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> do something. It still looks pretty though. Time to let it go and move on to more immediate commitments.</p>
<p>The time it takes to move from creating a new post with <code>hugo new post/post.md</code> with editing the generated page, adding, commiting and pushing is so low that I should be able to crank out posts fast. Never realized the process would be so fluid. Working on a linux machine after battling with windows for the last few months sure feels good.</p>
